## ⚙️ OOP Concepts Applied

We applied the following OOP principles to ensure a robust and scalable architecture:

### **Inheritance** (Code Reusability)
Allows sub-classes to reuse methods from parent classes.
* **Classes Used:** `Student Intern`, `Company`, `School`, `AdminMain`

### **Encapsulation** (Data Protection)
Bundles data and the methods that operate on it, limiting direct access to maintain integrity.
* **Classes Used:** `Evaluation`, `Internship`, `Task`, `TimeLog`

### **Polymorphism** (Flexible Behavior)
Allows objects to implement a common method differently, depending on their type.
* **Classes Used:** `Student Intern`, `Company`, `School`, `AdminMain`

### **Abstract Interface** (Defining Contracts)
Ensures specific classes adhere to a mandatory set of methods.
* **Classes Used:** `Abstract Class`, `Student Intern`, `Company`, `Evaluate`, `Tracker`
